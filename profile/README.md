‚òÑÔ∏èüí´ [`OrbitDB`](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database.

OrbitDB uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) as its data storage and [IPFS Pubsub](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/core/commands/pubsub.go#L23) and uses [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) to automatically sync databases with peers, achieving _strong eventual consistency_ - when all updates are eventually received, all nodes will have the same state.

## Funding

OrbitDB is currently funded by [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/orbitdb). Please visit our page there to learn more.

## Installation

The quickest way to get started with OrbitDB is to install the core module:

```js
npm i @orbitdb/core
```

## Repositories and Architecture

The [@orbitdb](https://github.com/orbitdb) organization on GitHub contains many different repositories. For the most part, these are either code which relates to OrbitDB, or are various non-code repositories for documentation and the like.

### Code-free repositories

**[Awesome OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/awesome-orbitdb)**, which is an attempt to list everything that is using OrbitDB, or could help people. Basically, what has been built?

### OrbitDB

OrbitDB is a peer-to-peer database for the decentralized web (to put it succinctly). The most important repository is:

**[OrbitDB Core](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb)** - The main repo for OrbitDB.

There are also 3rd party modules which are officially developed by OrbitDB. It should be noted that **all** of these are JavaScript modules on npm.

**[Ethereum Identity Provider](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb-identity-provider-ethereum)** - An Ethereum-based identity provider for OrbitDB.

**[DID Identity Provider](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb-identity-provider-did)** - A Decentralized IDentitifer identity provider for OrbitDB.

### Multilingual Implementations

There has been a recent explosion of awesome, ambitions, community-driven work towards interoperability with other languages. First came the **[orbit-db-http-api](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-http-api)**, followed by **[py-orbit-db-http-client](https://github.com/orbitdb/py-orbit-db-http-client)**, and  **[go-orbit-db](https://github.com/berty/go-orbit-db)**.

These repos started as community efforts and were brought into the organization soon after. However, search GitHub - there's a lot more.

The best place to find out what is available is likely by asking in the [Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#orbit-db:matrix.org). If you know of any other repos that ought to be included in this section, point them out to us!

### Press

Materials for press (logos, formats, guidelines, etc) are available **[here](https://github.com/orbitdb/logo)**. For interviews etc, reach out to [@aphelionz](https://twitter.com/aphelionz) on Twitter.

### Other repositories?

There are other repositories that aren't in the organization around the web which are important - for instance, of course, [ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs). For now, these are the main ones in the @orbitdb organization.

If there is something missing form this list, please let us know! Either open a PR or an issue, and we'll add it. Thank you.

### Naming

Why "OrbitDB"? Because it was available on GitHub, and it matches [`orbitdb`](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db). Why "Orbit"? Because that is the name of [the chat app built on top of orbit-db](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit). Why was that called "Orbit"? You'll have to ask [@haadcode](https://github.com/haadcode), but it's probably something to do with the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs).

There are variants of the name. For now, the canonical versions are: OrbitDB for the general project, `orbit-db` for the codebase at `orbitdb/orbit-db`, `@orbitdb` for the organization, and Orbit Chat for what used to be called just Orbit.
