> Default Community documents

This repository holds some default community documents for repositories. The master versions of these files are held at [OrbitDB/welcome](https://github.com/orbitdb/welcome). This repository automatically fills these files in for new repositories. For more, see [GitHub's functionality regarding .github folders](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization).

This does not enforce all documents - for instance, licenses. For that, look at the [repo-template](https://github.com/orbitdb/repo-template) repository.
